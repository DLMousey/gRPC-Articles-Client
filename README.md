# gRPC Article Service

Fiddling around with gRPC because it looks cool and potentially very useful for some future projects.
This is the client side of the implementation, currently only option 1 for retrieving the list of articles works.

This repo is a companion repo to [the server implementation](https://github.com/DLMousey/gRPC-Articles-Server)

## Future TODOs;
- Experiment with authorisation from client side
- Fix the menu
- Add options for creating and publishing/unpublishing items
